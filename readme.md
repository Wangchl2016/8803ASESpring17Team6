# Web Front End (Team 6)

[Web Server](http://35.185.35.101)

To run this code, it would be useful to use http-server-angular.

First, you will need to have npm installed on your computer.

Then, run ``npm install`` in the project folder.

Next, run ``./node_modules/.bin/angular-http-server`` or ``./runServer.sh`` as a shortcut.

Now, launch your web browser to ``http://127.0.0.1:8080``.


## To Run Tests

Run ``npm test``

To sync from here to the project repo:

    rsync -a --exclude='.git/' --exclude='server/' ./8803ASESpring17Team6/ ./8803ASESpring17PPPrj2/web/
